**Project** : Ecommerce modernization using Search Migrator  
**Team Number** : _insert team number here_  
**Team Name** : TeamChicago  
**Demonstration Video** : _Insert link to demonstration video_  

# Overview
We will demonstrate a process and prototype to modernize a product catalog using a Search migrator application powered by GenAI that converts Elasticsearch indexes and queries to Atlas Search components. The modernized product catalog on Atlas Search will also showcase powerful in-app search, and a chatbot powered by MongoDB vector search with RAG. Users will use the catalog to place digital orders that a Viam robot will fulfill in a store setting.



# Justification

We all as a solutions architects encounter Elastic Search Index every single day. But there isn't a seamless process/tools that makes the elastic search to atlas search index. Much like our beloved Relational Migrator. We call this our Search Migrator. It is a RAG archiecture powered by GPT4 model. The ecommerce website would then leverage these indexes to modernize the application using Atlas Search.

NOT JUST THAT. We wanted to add a physical dimension to the world of MongoDB and introduced a fully autonomous VIAM ROVER that leverages MongoDB TimeSeries Collection that can perform delivery service of the order placed in ecommerce site using sesors and machine learning services.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run `node server.js' for the backend

### `npm run build` fails to minify
